# React Timer

This is a simple timer built in React that offers options to start, stop and reset.<br> It's built mostly as a reference tool for other projects. 

You can run the deployed timer [here](https://kaitlynmcl.github.io/react-timer/), or download the app onto your local computer by cloning the repository.<br>
After cloning the repository onto your computer, you can run this command in the project directory:

###### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode and opens [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
